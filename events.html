            <p><i>GOG is a massively popular DRM free video game storefront and platform from CD Projekt.</i></p>
            <p>For many years now I have had a working relationship with GOG for some marketing events. During many of their sale promotions, I have constructed collaborative campaigns that have pushed for purchases during their sales, showcased items they had supplied to promote it, and helped increase traffic during the sale.</p>
            <p>Content of the events consisted of general posts, tweets, video content and giveaways.</p>

            <p>Much like GOG, for years I have held a positive working relationship with Fanatical's marketing team. During some big sale campaigns, as well as through updates to their <i>Mystery Bundle</i> offerings, I have built tie-in promotions that have pushed for sales, increased traffic, showcased items they supplied and improved engagement for the store on their social channels.</p>

            <p>To open 2024, AVerMedia were bringing their brand new line of 4K capture cards to the consumer and business market. I approached the company at the right time to be involved in a campaign that had me promote the new product(s) in live and edited form review/use, an unboxing, and some short form content. On top of that, we promoted the product and the brand with a giveaway event of some of their best products plus the brand new capture cards. We also aided in their engagement and brand awareness while promoting the product.</p>
            <p>After a successful campaign, both parties left happy and excited to collaborate further. They also put me in contact with another company that was involved in our event, which will allow us to work together further.</p>

            <p>This one was the first time I ever worked with a physical product for some sort of event. Prior events to this consisted of just digital copies of video games. This was a bit different to that. I approached the Asian-based Akko to work on brand awareness and the increase of their social presence. Together we promoted their wide line of products and got keyboards and key switches in the hands of excited new Akko fans.</p>
            <P>Content of the event consisted of the general post, tweets and the giveaway of their products world-wide (and some in North America only).</p>

            <p><i>A collection of some of the games I have worked with.</i></p>
            <p>During my time I have collaborated with a myriad of indie and AA developers and publishers to run events for pre-launch/launch windows/updates/etc. Rather than individually note this per title, I figured it would be best to bundle them.</p>
            <p>From regularly working with <b>WingedCloud</b>, to one-time collaborations with a developer's first ever product. I helped run plenty of campaigns that promoted games, events being run in games, and the social media platforms of the developer/publisher(s). One of the most common reasons for our events have been the launch of a game, which has gone to help promote wishlisting and buying said game.</p>
            <p>To list some developers and publishers off: <b>StudioFOW</b>, <b>Tonguc Bodur</b>, <b>WingedCloud</b>, <b>OddShot Games</b>, <b>Barnaque</b>, <b>PLAYWITH Inc.</b>, <b>Wales Interactive</b>, <b>Unit 2 Games Limited</b>, <b>Kuura Playhouse</b> and plenty more.</p>

            <h2>Large Out-Reach</h2>
            <p>The bulk of the events I have run, have been for the <b>FreeGameFindings</b> group that I made over a decade ago. Said group exists on many platforms, but the primary houses over <b>350,000 users</b>, with tens of thousands of users on other platforms as well. Platforms included are Reddit for the main, with secondary locations such as Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and more exist too.</p>

            <h2>Event Posts</h2>
            <p>Plenty of our events have been promotional giveaway posts where the collaborative party supplies product(s) to be used as incentive to promote engagement for the collaborator in some way. These events often have multiple elements to them, but the main is generally the landing page, or primary post on the FGF group subreddit. Said posts get priority viewing where our thousands of active users can partake in and view the event. While there, again, can be other elements to these events, the main post for them generally garner at least 100,000 tracked views, which require a user opening and reading the thread.</p>
            <p>Events like these always incorporate some sort of call to action for the users participating in them, resulting in promoting the collaborator's engagement and presence on platforms, or their games, etc. This is a mutual benefit as it also promotes our platform.</p>

            <h2>Giveaway Task Insights</h2>
            <p>When a giveaway is involved, to ensure that some of the tasks that benefit our collaborators ends up being used, meaning that they get their follows on their platforms or something like that, I use giveaway platforms to facilitate the entries. This results in requiring that users participate/engage in the events in full thus getting our collaborators what they are looking for.</p>
            <p>Not every user is going to participate in every giveaway event like this, but I still ensure I promote the collaborators in multiple ways even if our users don't always fully join in. This means text promotion in the main post, as well as the video content I create.</p>

            <h2>Video Content</h2>
            <p>Another aspect of FGF and the FGF collaborative events are the video content I produce. I create short-form videos to accommodate many posts for the FGF community. In terms of event videos, I have done a myriad of those as well.</p>
            <p>Video content is created to be shared onto other platforms and encourage further growth of FGF outside of Reddit. YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter all house video content (and more) that can regularly bring in some comfortable engagement and views which has further grown the main platform. Video content has been simply recapping the item being offered, showcasing gameplay and the like. On top of that have been unboxings and reviews.</p>

            <h2>Livestream Events</h2>
            <p>Somewhat related to the video content I create for FGF and FGF events are the livestream events I have constructed as well. These are a bit different as they leverage my own personal interest of livestreaming, but there has been documented crossover there as well, such as during a week-long stream event where I tied it in with an FGF event. While this differs, it still resulted in hundreds of live active viewers and promoted even further engagement.</p>
